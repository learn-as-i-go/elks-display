# WordPress-Style Slider Improvements

## ðŸ“Š **Typography Improvements**

### **Before:**
```css
.slide-title {
    font-size: 4rem;
    text-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    background: linear-gradient(...);
    animation: titleGlow 2s infinite;
}

.slide-text {
    font-size: 1.8rem;
}
```

### **After:**
```css
.slide-title {
    font-size: 4.5rem;
    color: #FFD700;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
    /* Clean, readable styling */
}

.slide-text {
    font-size: 2.2rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
    /* Much more readable */
}
```

## ðŸŽ¬ **Animation Sequence Example**

For a typical slide transition:

```
0.0s: Slide becomes active, all elements hidden
0.3s: "Join Our Membership Committee" slides in from left
0.8s: "Every Tuesday at 7:00 PM" bounces down
1.3s: Content area with image fades up
1.8s: Image flips in with 3D effect
2.3s: "Lodge Hall" slides in with glow
```

Next slide might be:
```
0.0s: New slide active
0.3s: "Weekly Bingo Night" scales up from center
0.8s: "Fridays at 6:30 PM" rotates in
1.3s: Content slides in from left
1.8s: Image scales up smoothly
2.3s: "Community Center" fades in
```
