## üö® Critical Actions Required

### Immediate Actions (Do These First!)
1. **Change Default Password**

   chmod 644 uploads/*
   chmod 750 logs/
   chmod 640 includes/config.php
   ```

3. **Test Security Features**
   - [ ] Verify CSRF protection is working
   - [ ] Test file upload restrictions
   - [ ] Confirm rate limiting works
   - [ ] Check security logging is active

### Database Security Setup
4. **Create Dedicated Database User**
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'signage_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'STRONG_RANDOM_PASSWORD';
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON digital_sign.* TO 'signage_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

5. **Update Database Configuration**
   - [ ] Update `includes/config.php` with new credentials
   - [ ] Use strong, unique password
   - [ ] Test database connection

### Web Server Configuration
6. **Enable Required Apache Modules**
   ```bash
   a2enmod rewrite
   a2enmod headers
   a2enmod deflate
   a2enmod expires
   ```

7. **SSL/TLS Setup (Recommended)**
   - [ ] Install SSL certificate
   - [ ] Configure HTTPS redirect
   - [ ] Enable HSTS header in .htaccess
