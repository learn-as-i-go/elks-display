## 💡 **How to Create New Admin Pages**

Creating a new admin page is now incredibly simple:

```php
<?php
// Set page-specific variables
$page_title = 'My New Page';
$page_icon = '🆕';
$page_description = 'Description of what this page does';

// Include unified header
include 'header.php';

// Your page logic here
?>

<!-- Your page content here -->
<div class="form-section">
    <h2>My Content</h2>
    <p>This page automatically has navigation, styling, and JavaScript!</p>
</div>

<?php include 'footer.php'; ?>
```

That's it! The page automatically gets:
- ✅ Navigation with correct active highlighting
- ✅ All CSS styling
- ✅ JavaScript functions (image preview, confirmDelete, etc.)
- ✅ Session message handling
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Convert remaining pages** to use the unified system
2. **Test bulk photo upload** with your PER and board member photos
3. **Remove old CSS** from individual files once converted
4. **Add any additional features** to header/footer as needed

The admin system is now much more maintainable and professional. Adding new features or making changes will be significantly easier going forward!
